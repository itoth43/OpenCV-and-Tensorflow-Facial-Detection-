# Facial Detection "SnapChat Mimic"

For those interested in getting started with Googles Tensorflow, Deep/Machine Learning, and Object Detection and Tracking.

This is a simple Python program using OpenCV (https://opencv.org) made to mimic the snapchats
filter idea, using facial detection and tracking and Haar Cascades.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing and Important Files

#### Python

Download and Install Python (be sure to check the options for Pip3 install and PATH appending):
https://www.python.org/downloads/

(I am using Python 3.6.3):
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/

#### OpenCV

Download and Install openCV:

Windows:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases
(opencv-3.3.1-vc14.exe)

Mac:
brew install opencv3 --with-contrib

(Homebrew Install if not installed already):
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#### Haar Cascades

Haar Cascades:
A Haar Cascade works by training the cascade on thousands of negative images with the positive image superimposed on it. The haar cascade is capable of detecting features from the source.
